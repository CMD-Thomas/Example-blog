				<p>Who? Well me. Who's me? I'm a 25 year old student who aspires to become a front end developer. As off now I'm nearing graduation around August I will be done. My skills include: HTML, CSS JavaScript, a bit Node (this is build with Node) and I've smelled on Meteor and Angular but haven't continued with it. In the future I wish to focus a lot on JavaScript, back-end and front-end</p>
				
				<p>My other hobbies include: cooking, craft beers, computer games, chess, (international) draughts, writing, reading (especially fantasy and science fiction) and the list continues. Feel free to hit me up on any of these subjects.</p>

				<p>A frikkin' blog. Build with Node from scratch. Obviously I used a whole lot of frameworks but the important thing is I did it. The only thing I didn't do is make the designs. I used a UI kit from inVision. I scratched and added some things to make it more my own but their designs are still recognizable.</p>

				<p>Why would you make a blog? Well for one, I like to write, I like to share my views or finds and place them somewhere.</p>
				<p>I chose to make my own blog from scratch because I thought it would be good practice - truth to be told - I learned a ton. Also I picked the pain-staking way of building it from scratch - as opposed to picking Wordpress - because I feel I only needed a blog. A blog is something different than a total CMS. (wordpress has 30k+ plugins, I've got none because I don;t need it).</p><p>This blog is very much a work in progress though. I can recall how I thought I was 70% done, when I made a feature list I suddenly realized how this project was starting to grow on me. When I was done thinking about all the features I wanted, it dawned on me I was only 20% done.</p></p>
				However rather then making a fully finished product I went for a mvp and that's the product you're looking at now. It works but I stil have a ton of work planned.</p>
